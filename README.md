# StockManagement

The project is designed in accordance with Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles. Thanks to the layered architecture, business logic, data access, and presentation layers are separated from each other. It uses the CQRS pattern to separate command and query operations. The project also applies response and request patterns using Automapper. This allows for easy conversion between data transfer objects (DTO) and domain objects. It is developed using Entity Framework. The service document is provided below.
